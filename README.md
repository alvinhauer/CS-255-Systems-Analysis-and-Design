# CS-255-Systems-Analysis-and-Design

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is looking to provide students with the ability to practice and hone their driving skills.  DriverPass wanted a system that could manage driving practice reservations and provide an updated course curriculum that included current state rules and regulations via DMV database connectivity.

#What did you do particularly well?
A lot of my diagrams looked good.  I was able to understand a lot of the concepts behind UML, especially object models

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would look at revising my functional and non-functional requirements.  Being that I feel I have a better grasp of this concept, I feel I can depict these requirements better than my previous attempt.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Overall, I think I did a decent job listening to the user's needs and concerns.  I feel this is important in order to deliver a product that the user will want and appreciate implementing into their business.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I try to approach software design by breaking the project down into smaller pieces that are easier to "digest".  Techniques that I would use in the future definitely involve UML diagrams and utilization of the Gantt Chart to help ensure that I stay on task to meet presribed timelines.
